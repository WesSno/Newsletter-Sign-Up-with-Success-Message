# Frontend Mentor - Newsletter sign-up form with success message solution

A responsive newsletter sign-up application built with React (function-based components only). This project focuses on strengthening core React concepts such as hooks, controlled components, custom form validation, and state-driven UI rendering.

This solution is inspired by the [Newsletter sign-up form with success message challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.
